# Pokestar Move System

This rule covers key patterns and best practices for working with moves in [moves.js](mdc:src/battle/data/moves.js) in the Pokestar battle system. If asked to implement or modify a move, DO NOT modify other moves unless explicitly asked to.

## Unique Aspects

Moves in Pokestar differ from traditional Pokémon games:

- **Move Tiers**: Moves are categorized as Basic, Power, or Ultimate, each with different cooldown and power expectations
- **Cooldowns**: Moves can't be used again until their cooldown expires
- **Area of Effect (AoE)**: Moves target specific patterns of Pokémon on the battlefield
- **Targeting Rules**: Moves specify which positions can be targeted and who can be affected

## Move Structure

```javascript
[moveIdEnum.MOVE_NAME]: new Move({
  id: moveIdEnum.MOVE_NAME,
  name: "Move Name",
  type: pokemonTypes.TYPE,
  power: 80,  // Base power
  accuracy: 100,  // Hit chance percentage
  cooldown: 3,  // Turns before usable again
  targetType: targetTypes.OPPONENT,  // Who can be targeted
  targetPosition: targetPositions.ANY,  // Which positions
  targetPattern: targetPatterns.SINGLE,  // Area of effect
  tier: moveTiers.POWER,  // Basic, Power, or Ultimate
  damageType: damageTypes.PHYSICAL,  // Physical or Special
  description: "Description of the move",
  execute(args) {
    // Implementation goes here
  },
}),
```

**NOTE:** The `execute` function binds `this` to the @MoveInstance.js `MoveInstance` class, which holds information about the move's lifecycle, such as current `source`, `primaryTarget`, `allTargets`, and `missedTargets`. It also has generic methods for common move execution functions.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Generic Methods

Always use the `MoveInstance` class's generic methods for common operations:

```javascript
// For damage
this.genericDealAllDamage();

// For status
this.genericApplyAllStatus({
  statusId: statusConditions.BURNED,
  probability: 0.3
});

// For effects
this.genericApplyAllEffects({
  effectId: effectIdEnum.ATK_UP,
  duration: 3,
  probability: 0.5
});

// For combat readiness changes
this.genericChangeAllCombatReadiness({
  amount: 25,
  action: "boost"
});
```
